finished annotator for entities in practice classifier folder
	everything saves to annotated_for_entities.dat

edited streamer.py
	now looks for links and rts on the fly, does not 'download' them

Okay embarassing this may be, I haven't touched this in a month, but here's the deal

have edited streamer.py so that it automatically writes to a json file
and also have added a ceiling to the number, so I won't get, like, more than a thousand, this can be fixed

Now it creates a .dat file kind of like this:

filter1_filter2_day_month_year.dat

Okay so I went to annotate some more tweets and I ran into two problems:
-It said that I had annotated 4800 tweets, when I really had done 58, so I think something's wrong with my annotaton program

-I don't really know what should be an entity. I mean, I guess I should be just seeing if the Hillary is
actually the Hillary, but then what about mispellings? FUCK, I'm going to throw up.

So, for the future, I need to fix #1 and get ~1000 annotated then classified and then get my shit together wrt #2

September 7th

Okay did a couple of things, the first and foremost is I got started on a classifier to say whether or
not it is polar or neutral tweet
it's in the practice_classifier folder
I downloaded a lexicon
and right now the classifier all the polar words into one set
but maybe we want to do the bayesian thing?
the program is called sentiment_classifier.py and takes no entries

8 September 2016
created pushmepullyou.sh, which syncs things with the ssh server
set up git
I had forgotten to strip newlines from lexicon reader
now can actually classify based off of the thing
start keeping track tomorrow
