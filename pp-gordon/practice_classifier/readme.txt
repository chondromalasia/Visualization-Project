Okay jesus christ, there's something wrong with the annotator but it spits out extras.

24 August 2016
Okay I cleaned up the annotated_for_entities.dat, have renamed it to annotated_for_entities_old_date.dat
and the cleaned version is the new annotated_for_entities.dat.

IF this continues, and I have no reason to believe that it won't, then you can use tester_thing.py
to clean up the annotated data. Fucking Christ.
